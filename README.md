# WindowPosition
It positions and resizes window. Because ~~Spotify~~ some programs is too f\*ken stupid to do it by themselves.

## Usage
WindowPosition.exe `<process name> <monitor index> <left offset> <right offset> <top offset> <bottom offet>`
	
* **Process name** is the executable file name running on the computer.

* **Monitor index** declares which monitor the window will be placed on. The value should be 1 or higher and not exceed the number of monitors connected.

* Offsets are described in absolute percentages between [0-100]. For example setting left to 50 and right to 100 aligns a window on the right side half portion of the screen.
